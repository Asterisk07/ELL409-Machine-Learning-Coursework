# Intro to Machine Learning

This directory contains the code and projects I've created while learning machine learning basics. It serves as a collection of my work during the introductory phase of my machine learning journey.

## Resources

During my learning journey, I used the following resources:

1. **"Introduction to PyTorch : Microsoft Learn"**
   - [Link to Resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-machine-learning-pytorch/)
   - Explore key PyTorch concepts for building machine learning models, including Tensor usage, dataset management, image recognition with neural networks, model optimization, and inference performance enhancement.

2. **"Tensor methods from official docs"**
   - [Link to Resource](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html)
   - Discover essential tensor methods and functionalities in PyTorch through the official documentation.


These resources played a significant role in shaping my understanding of machine learning. I encourage you to explore them if you're on your own learning journey in this field.

## Requirements

To run the code and projects in this directory, you may need to install specific Python packages and dependencies. You can find a list of these requirements in the "requirements.txt" file provided in this directory. To install the required packages, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
